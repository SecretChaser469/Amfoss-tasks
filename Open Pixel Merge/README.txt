Requirements
OpenCV: For image processing and detecting dots in the images.
Pillow (PIL): For manipulating and drawing on the images.
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install opencv-python Pillow
Steps
Step 1: Organize the Images
Each image is named with a number, which determines its order. First, we need to load all the images and sort them based on the number in their filenames.
Step 2: Detect the Dot Using OpenCV
The dots in each image have different colors, and the images have a white background. We can detect the dot by finding the non-white pixels in each image. OpenCV makes this relatively easy.
Step 3: Record the Dot’s Position and Color
For each image, once the dot is detected, record its position (coordinates) and color. This will be important when drawing the lines between dots.
Step 4: Handle Line Breaks
Some images are completely white, which indicates a "line break." When you encounter these images, you should stop drawing the line from the previous dot.
Step 5: Draw Lines Using Pillow
After detecting and recording the dots, we’ll use Pillow to draw lines between the dots on successive images. The line's color should match the starting dot's color. Use the coordinates from OpenCV to determine the line's path.
Explanation of Key Functions
load_images(folder):

This function loads all image files from the specified folder and sorts them by filename (assuming the filenames are numbers). It returns the filenames and the loaded images.
detect_dot(image):

This function uses OpenCV to detect the dot in the image. First, it converts the image to grayscale, then applies a threshold to isolate non-white pixels. It returns the dot’s coordinates and color.
draw_line(draw, start_pos, end_pos, color):

This function draws a line between two positions (start_pos and end_pos) using Pillow's ImageDraw. The line color matches the dot's color.
is_white_image(image):

This function checks if the given image is entirely white. It's used to handle the "line break" condition, where no line should be drawn from the previous image to this one.
stitch_images(folder):

This is the main function that iterates through all the images. For each image, it checks for the dot’s position and color, and if it's not a white image, draws a line between consecutive dots. The result is saved as stitched_image.png.
Steps to Run the Script
Place all the images in a folder (e.g., assets).
Update the folder variable in the script to the correct path where the images are located.
Run the script in your terminal:

python your_script_name.py
The final image will be saved as stitched_image.png in the current directory.
Customization
You can further customize the script, such as:

Changing the line width or color schemes.
Adding logging to track which images were processed.
Handling edge cases, such as missing images or malformed image files.
